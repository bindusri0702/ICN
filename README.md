This repository consists of python code that analyses anomalies in ECG5000 dataset <br/>
It compares the performance between TF and TFlite model <br/>
The machine learning model used here is autoencoder neural network model <br/>
Using autoencoder we were able to reconstruct ECG signal and find the training loss <br/>
Comparing the training losses of normal and anomalous rythms set the threshold to determine classify unknown ECG signal as anomalous or normal.
